# SimpleServoTester

##
Still WIP

## About
Simple project for quick on-the-go servo testing. It has two different modes, manual one for controlling the servo position via rotary encoder and automatic (sweep) mode.
 
## Project status
- [x] Breadboard prototype
- [x] Schematic
- [x] PCB
- [ ] Enclosure design
- [ ] 3D CAD assembly and renders
- [ ] Assembly
- [ ] Programming

## Main features
- Based on popular ATmega328p microcontroller used on Arduino boards
- Powered by 2x18650 batteries
- IN219 current sense IC
- Rotary encoder for mode selection

## BOM
The components used are the ones that were available at-hand during the process of development. Therefore BOM for this project is not optimal.
